# Problems in Failing Tests

## 1. tests/builtins/N3LogicLogicBuiltins.test.ts
### Problem: log:or returns true if either is true (string and boolean cases)
- **Description:**
  - The test expects that `log:or(lit('x'), lit(''))` and `log:or(lit(''), lit('x'))` both return `true`.
  - The current implementation returns `false` for `log:or(lit('x'), lit(''))`, which is incorrect.
  - The logic is not symmetric: it does not treat either argument as independently truthy if it is a non-empty string (not 'false').
- **Root Cause:**
  - The `isTruthy` function or its application does not correctly handle the case where only one argument is a non-empty string.
  - The function may be short-circuiting or not evaluating both arguments properly.

## 2. tests/reasoner.test.ts
### Problem: N3LogicReasoner › supports custom builtins
- **Description:**
  - The test expects 3 inferred triples, but only 2 are produced.
  - The rule involving a custom builtin is not firing as expected.
- **Root Cause:**
  - The parser is not extracting or applying rules correctly, or the matcher is not invoking the custom builtin as intended.
  - This may be due to issues in rule extraction, triple matching, or builtin registration.

## 3. tests/reasoner/debug.test.ts
### Problem: debugLog and setDebug › should log when DEBUG is true
- **Description:**
  - The test expects the debug log function to be called when DEBUG is set to true.
  - The test fails because the log function is not called (received 0 calls).
- **Root Cause:**
  - The debug logging mechanism is not triggering the log output as expected when DEBUG is enabled.
  - This could be due to the way the spy is set up, or the debugLog/setDebug implementation not affecting the logging as intended.
