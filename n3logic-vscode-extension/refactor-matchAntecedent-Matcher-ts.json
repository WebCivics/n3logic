  "title": "Refactor matchAntecedent in matcher.ts",
  "description": "Refactoring plan to improve clarity, maintainability, and testability of matchAntecedent.",
  "todos": [
    "Split matchAntecedent into smaller helper functions:",
    "  - Logging/debugging patterns and data",
    "  - Builtin matching logic",
    "  - Data triple matching logic",
    "  - Normalizing bindings",
    "Add early returns and guard clauses for trivial cases (e.g., empty patterns)",
    "Extract builtin lookup logic into a dedicated function (e.g., findBuiltinForPredicate)",
    "Centralize debug logging to avoid repetition and allow easy verbosity control",
    "Parameterize recursion helpers (like matchAntecedent itself) for easier testing/mocking",
    "Use type guards and pattern matching to clarify intent and reduce scattered type checks",
    "Use a clear accumulator pattern for results, possibly with a reducer",
    "Make each logical step (builtin invocation, triple matching, binding normalization) a pure function for easier unit testing"
