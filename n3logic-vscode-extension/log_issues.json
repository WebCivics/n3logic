  "summary": "Comprehensive log and test review for n3logic-vscode-extension as of 2025-08-02.\n\nAll demo-app regression scenarios pass, and the matcher and parser now robustly handle custom builtins and diagnostic inference. Extensive debug output is present throughout the inference pipeline, including matcher, parser, and builtin evaluator. However, several unrelated test failures remain, and further improvements to debug trace functionality are recommended for maintainability and future diagnosis.",

The matcher and builtin evaluator now correctly invoke custom builtins, and inference works as expected. All regression runner and demo-app scenarios pass. Extensive debug output at TRACE and DEBUG levels is present for all key inference steps, including triple parsing, rule extraction, builtin matching, and triple instantiation.",

    "No further action needed for custom builtin or diagnostic inference issues—they are fixed and fully validated by regression runners and demo-apps.",

    "Fix the redeclaration of __filename in N3LogicAIAgentHelper.test.ts to allow the test suite to run. This may require removing or renaming the variable, or adjusting the test setup to avoid conflicts.",
    "Continue using and further enhance the debug output and file path logging. Consider the following improvements to debug trace functionality: \n  - Standardize debug output format and levels (TRACE, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR) across all modules.\n  - Add a global debug configuration to control verbosity and output destinations (console, file, etc).\n  - Ensure all key inference steps (parsing, rule extraction, triple matching, builtin invocation, triple instantiation) emit traceable, context-rich logs, including file and line references where possible.\n  - Provide utilities to filter, search, and summarize debug logs for rapid diagnosis.\n  - Document debug output conventions and usage in the project README for future maintainers."
