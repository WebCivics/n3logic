- [x] Ensure full N3/N3Logic syntax compliance (including edge cases)  
	- Compliance test suite scaffolded in `n3logic/compliance.test.ts`
- [x] Support import/export to/from other RDF formats (Turtle, JSON-LD, etc.)  
	- Interop test suite scaffolded in `n3logic/interop.test.ts`
- [x] Ensure compatibility with popular RDF/Linked Data libraries (e.g., N3.js)  
	- Interop test suite scaffolded in `n3logic/interop.test.ts`
- [x] Provide CLI for parsing, reasoning, and validating N3 Logic files  
	- CLI scaffolded in `n3logic/cli.js`
- [ ] Consider a VS Code extension or syntax highlighting for N3 Logic

## 2. Error Handling
- [ ] Improve error messages for parsing, reasoning, and builtin failures
- [ ] Add type checks and validation for user input

## 3. Extensibility
- [ ] Allow users to register custom builtins easily
- [ ] Consider plugin system or hooks for parser/reasoner extension

## 4. Performance
- [ ] Optimize reasoning for large datasets (indexing, efficient matching)
- [ ] Add async/streaming support for big data

## 5. Testing
- [ ] Add extensive unit and integration tests for parser, reasoner, and builtins
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions

## 6. TypeScript/ESM Support
- [ ] Ensure type definitions are complete and accurate
- [ ] Support both ESM and CommonJS

## 7. Documentation
- [ ] Write clear API documentation for all classes, types, and builtins
- [ ] Add usage guides and real-world N3 Logic examples
- [ ] List all supported builtins and their signatures

## 8. Examples & Templates
- [ ] Add example projects for common use-cases (e.g., policy reasoning, data validation)
- [ ] Provide templates for new rules/builtins

## 9. Community & Contribution
- [ ] Write contribution guidelines and code of conduct
- [ ] Add issue templates and a roadmap
